                <h3>Welcome to WhatMolecule!</h3>
                <p>Imagine building a LEGO set, where each LEGO piece represents a different element from the periodic table. When you snap these pieces together in specific ways, you create something new and complete—a molecule. Just like combining LEGO bricks to make a spaceship or a castle, combining different elements like hydrogen and oxygen forms molecules, such as water (H₂O). These molecules are the building blocks of everything around us, from the air we breathe to the cells in our bodies. Simply put, when elements join forces, they create molecules, giving rise to the diverse materials and substances that make up our world.</p>

                <h3>Exploring Molecules with WhatMolecule:</h3>
                <p>WhatMolecule is a fantastic tool that allows you to explore the fascinating world of molecules by selecting different elements and seeing the combinations that result. By choosing from several elements, you can observe how they combine to form various molecules, providing a hands-on way to learn about chemical bonds and molecular structures. This tool makes the complex process of molecular formation more accessible and engaging, letting you visualize the building blocks of matter in an interactive way.</p>
                
                <h3>What is a Molecule?</h3><!--This text was generated by AI-->
                <p>Molecules are the smallest units of chemical compounds that retain their unique chemical properties. They consist of two or more atoms bonded together by chemical bonds, such as covalent, ionic, or metallic bonds. These bonds hold the atoms together and determine the molecule's structure and stability. Molecules can vary greatly in size and complexity, from simple molecules like oxygen (O₂) and nitrogen (N₂), which consist of two atoms, to large and complex molecules like proteins and DNA, which contain thousands of atoms. Understanding molecules and their interactions is fundamental to the study of chemistry, biology, and materials science, as they form the basis of all matter in the universe.</p>
