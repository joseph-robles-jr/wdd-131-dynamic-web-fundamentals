		<h2>Intro</h2>
		<p>Imagine building a LEGO set, where each LEGO piece represents a different element from the periodic table.
			When you snap these pieces together in specific ways, you create something new and complete—a molecule. Just
			like combining LEGO bricks to make a spaceship or a castle, combining different elements like hydrogen and
			oxygen forms molecules, such as water (H₂O). These molecules are the building blocks of everything around
			us, from the air we breathe to the cells in our bodies. Simply put, when elements join forces, they create
			molecules, giving rise to the diverse materials and substances that make up our world.</p>

		<h2>Exploring Molecules with WhatMolecule:</h2>

		<p>WhatMolecule is a fantastic tool that allows you to explore the fascinating world of molecules by selecting
			different elements and seeing the combinations that result. By choosing from several elements, you can
			observe how they combine to form various molecules, providing a hands-on way to learn about chemical bonds
			and molecular structures. This tool makes the complex process of molecular formation more accessible and
			engaging, letting you visualize the building blocks of matter in an interactive way.</p>
